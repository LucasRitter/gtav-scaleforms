# **Grand Theft Auto V** - Scaleform Wrappers

Scaleforms in Grand Theft Auto V are a pain to work with, no matter what scripting framework you use, be it [ScriptHookV.NET](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet) or [RAGE Plugin Hook](https://ragepluginhook.net). After seeing so many of my friends with the same passion for the game struggle with them, I decided to make their lives easier and wrap the Scaleform movies with concise, simple, yet elegant wrappers.

## 🏗 **Supported Frameworks**
### **C# / .NET**
- [ScriptHookV.NET](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet) `>= 2.10.5`
- [RAGE Plugin Hook](https://ragepluginhook.net) `>= 0.62-alpha`

## 🤔 **FAQ**
- **There is only a C# wrapper. Pls gib for [** \**insert language here*\* **].**  
I have plans to release the wrapper for JavaScript for use with Alt:V in the future. If you want to have it for a different framework, please create an issue.

- **I created my own Scaleform movie, can I host the wrapper here?**  
Sadly, no.  
I only want to host wrappers for the Scaleforms provided by the [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software) game. This is to keep it consistent between multiple frameworks.

## 🤗 **Implementations**
### **C# / .NET**
- [**SpotifyRage**](https://github.com/lucasritter/spotify-rage) by [Lucas Ritter](https://github.com/lucasritter)
